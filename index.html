<p>ScatterCraft is a vanilla, whitelisted Minecraft survival server. It was inspired by <a href="http://hermitcraft.com" target="_blank">HermitCraft</a>, a server where popular content makers play together and upload videos of them playing. We started our first world in April of 2016 using the seed that HermitCraft used for their fourth season, and we started our second world and first season on May 5, 2017, using the seed that HermitCraft is using for their fifth season. A few of us will be recording videos on there, but you certainly do not have to be a content maker to join. If you're looking for an idea of what sort of things we do on here, the backgrounds of all four pages were all built in legitimate survival on ScatterCraft. If you see things that look like they were built in creative when you're on, we promise: they weren't. We just have very talented and motivated builders. 
<p class="listheading">We do have a few slight modifications to the game to make it more friendly for a multiplayer server, similar to Hermitcraft. There are seven of them:
<ul>
<li>The dungeon count has been cranked up to max so more people can have personal mob farms.
<li>Only one person has to sleep to pass the night so that an AFK player doesn't stop everyone from sleeping.
<li>The ender dragon drops an elytra so that everyone on the server can have one.
<li>A shulker drops more shells than vanilla so that technical players can get more shulker boxes.
<li>Enderman griefing (but not the mobGriefing gamerule) is disabled so that the terrain don't get destroyed over time.
<li>The doFireTick gamerule is disabled so people's builds don't get burned down.
<li>The maxEntityCramming gamerule is set to 200 so people can make farms that revolve around mobs building up, but not crash the server.
</ul>
<p>If you're looking for an intensive, quick-paced server, this probably isn't the right place for you. But if you're the sort of person that likes to come home at night and spend a relaxing hour chipping away at a big project in your survival world, no matter who you are, we would love to have you.
