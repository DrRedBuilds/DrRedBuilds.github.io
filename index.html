<p>ScatterCraft is a vanilla, whitelisted Minecraft survival server. It was inspired by <a href="http://hermitcraft.com" target="_blank">HermitCraft</a>, a server where popular content creators play together and upload videos of them playing. Like HermitCraft, we feel no need to modify the game. Let's face it: to the masses, Minecraft is boring. On surface level, it looks like a game with terrible graphics and no point. If you have no motivation, you will not have fun. But once you get through your first night, once you've killed the monsters that try to kill you, once you've made your first dirt hovel to protect yourself, you start to realize the potential in those 16-bit cubes. You might start to realize that Minecraft is more than a game: it's a canvas, even an artform. It takes a certain kind of person to find the potential of vanilla Minecraft, to get past the surface level of fighting zombies and building dirt cubes. But once you do get past that point, you'll find that you can't stop thinking of all the endless possibilites of things to build in your blocky, quirky world.
<p>But after the initial thrill of discovery of how great this game is, you probably learned pretty quickly that isn't fun to play alone, with only NPC villagers and pigs to keep you company. And you probably tried servers, but found that they didn't quite feel right. Maybe there were rules so strictly enforced that it ruined the freedom of vanilla minecraft. Maybe they had no rules, and you were forced to keep your posessions and base a secret so you could stay safe. You probably wanted to find a friendly community with a happy medium, where you could have free will and still feel safe displaying your hard work to the public. You probably clicked on our somewhat boring looking server in a server list filled with other more exciting looking servers. You bothered to come to our website and to read all this. If you came here to find a competitive and fast-paced anarchy or factions server where you can rise to the top, please, don't apply. There are other fantastic servers out there that would suit you better. But if you've been reading this with a feeling of mounting excitement, if you feel that you've been looking for something like this for years, if you yearn for a tight-knit community like HermitCraft, no matter who you are, we would love to have you. Please, click <a href="overflow.html">here</a> to apply. We usually accept applications on Mondays and Fridays.
<p class="listheading">We do have a few slight modifications to the game to make it more friendly for a multiplayer server, similar to Hermitcraft. There are seven of them:
<ul>
<li>The dungeon count has been cranked up to max so more people can have personal mob farms.
<li>Only one person has to sleep to pass the night so that an AFK player doesn't stop everyone from sleeping.
<li>The ender dragon drops an elytra so that everyone on the server can have one.
<li>Shulkers drop more shells than vanilla so that technical players can get more shulker boxes.
<li>Enderman griefing (but not the mobGriefing gamerule) is disabled so that the terrain don't get destroyed over time.
<li>The doFireTick gamerule is disabled so people's builds don't get burned down.
<li>The maxEntityCramming gamerule is set to 200 so people can make farms that revolve around mobs building up, but not crash the server.
</ul>
