<div class="text">
<p>If you play on ScatterCraft and want to make it better for everyone, feel free to make a monthly pledge. There will <i>never</i> be an obligation to donate&mdash;ScatterCraft will always be a completely free-to-play server. However, all donations will go directly back into the server, making it more playable and enjoyable for everyone. 
<p>Also, you do get a few benefits. You will get the donator rank on Discord and will be put in the official ScatterCraft donator hall (once we build it). Also, once you've played on the server for a few months and if we feel you are trustworthy, you will be made an administrator and an operator in-game. 
<p>This means you can do things to improve server performance, such as kicking AFK players because of lag or going into spectator mode to investigate entity build-up. This does <i>not</i> mean that you can do anything to benefit yourself, such as giving yourself items or going into creative mode. If we see you abusing any of these priviliges, you will lose them. It is your choice from there whether you want to keep donating or not. 
<p>If you decide stop donating, you will get the former donator rank on Discord and you will be put in the former donator part of the donator hall.
<p>Donating will make the server better for everyone, and we appreciate every donation, no matter how small. We can keep the server up without donations, but they are certainly a big help. To donate, go <a href="https://www.paypal.me/ScatterCraft" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>Current Monthly Donators:
<br>ThatGuyJimBob - $7.49
<br>EpicDiamonight - $2.50
